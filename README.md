# Task Tracker App

The Task Tracker Web Application is a productivity web app that is in the process of being developed. The web app allows the users to register for an account, login, create, read, update and delete tasks that the users set for themselves. This initial purpose of this web application was just a fun side project for me to learn and develop my skills in both frontend and backend but I've been inspired to push for more features to be implemented, and I will eventually deploy this project to heroku in the near future. I am building this project to be for anyone to use, so you can use this app for homework assignments, chores or a big project that you are a part of.

#### Features/requirements:
User must register for an account in order gain access to the application.

### Future features:
